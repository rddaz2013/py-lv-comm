Python-LabVIEW Communication
===============================

Scripts to communicate between Python and LabVIEW

Application example: You have some nice scripts written in Python and want to exploit the easy GUI-creation in LabVIEW to display results from the Python scripts. Or maybe you already have a LabVIEW program and want to extend its capabilities using Python.


Requirements
--------

* Python 3.5
* LabVIEW 2013
* [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/)
